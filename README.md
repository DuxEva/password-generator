- **Character Type Selection:** Users can include or exclude character types (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols) in their generated passwords.
  
- **Password Strength Indicator:** The generated password's strength is visually indicated using a strength bar, which categorizes passwords into "Too Weak," "Weak," "Medium," and "Strong" based on the selected character types.

- **Password Copying:** Users can copy the generated password to their clipboard with a single click using the copy button.
